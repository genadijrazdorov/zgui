Idea and project goals
======================

Today's GUI development heavily depends on a design process.  Because GUI
design requires different skill set from software development, it becomes big
barrier for a non designer to develop GUI.

Idea behind zGUI project is to enable easy building of a GUI, by automating
most of the design process and hiding all but the highest level of abstraction
from the developer.

Clear separation of application from user interface (UI) and style ("look and feel")

zGUI is trying to adhere to published guidelines of major platforms:

    * `Design basics for Desktop applications (Microsoft)
      <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742446.aspx>`_
    * `Design and UI for UWP apps (Microsoft)
      <https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design>`_
    * `Human Interface Guidelines (Apple)
      <https://developer.apple.com/design/>`_
    * `Up and running with material design (Android)
      <https://developer.android.com/design/index.html>`_
    * `GNOME Human Interface Guidelines
